# Gemstone Groupies
This is a Sinatra web app that lets you save stones to your profile.  See other peoples stones and comment on their collections.

## Install
To use the app run bundle install in your terminal.  Then rake db:migrate to ensure you see all the current users.

## Running the App
This app uses shotgun and once you are ready run shotgun in the terminal and visit the address listed after listening on.  Most cases this will be localhost:9393.  From here you can now use the app in the browser.
